# Remove InstantPurchase

This module removes Instant Purchase functionality from front-end, while it
still allows this module to be enabled.

The InstantPurchase module cannot be disabled due to Paypal module depending on
it.

This should slightly speed-up the loading of product page due to one script
less to be loaded.
